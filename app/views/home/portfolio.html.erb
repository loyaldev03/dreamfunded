		  <p class= "faq-answer">
            Investing in private companies is always risky but there are ways you can mitigate your risk and increase your chances of success. Building a strong portfolio of investments is key to manage and mitigate this risk.  Diversification is a fundamental strategy for successful angel investing.
      </p>

      <p class= "faq-answer">
        The <a href="http://www.kauffman.org/" target="_blank">Kauffman Foundation</a> did a study on <a href="http://sites.kauffman.org/pdf/angel_groups_111207.pdf"  target="_blank">Returns to Angels Investors in Groups</a>. What the researchers found is that successful investors are invested in a portfolio of at least 20 or more companies.  The study also found that putting lower dollar amounts into more companies had a better overall return than investing larger amounts in a couple of companies. Spreading out your investments in multiple companies can statistically improve the returns from your portfolio.

      <h2 class= "darkblue centered">About DreamFunded’s Low Dollar Amount</h2>

      <p class= "faq-answer">
        DreamFunded’s low investment minimum ($3,000) allows investors to build a strong portfolio of private equity investments in proven, pre-IPO companies like Uber, DropBox and Airbnb. Low investment minimums allow investors to mitigate risk without risking a large percentage of your net worth. Remember: pre-IPO companies offer investors a much lower risk profile than early-stage seed investing and present a significantly quicker return time (est. avg. return of 1-3 years).
